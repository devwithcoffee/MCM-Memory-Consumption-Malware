# Modified - MCM 2.0 (Memory Consumption Malware)
## Description: 
This C++ program creates an indefinite number of folders in the C:\ drive on a Windows system. The program does the following:

1.Sets a base path to "C:."
2.Defines a folder name as "MachiavelliFolder."
3.Initiates a count variable to track the number of created folders.
4.Uses Windows API functions to hide the console window.
5.Enters an infinite loop that creates folders in the form of "C:\MachiavelliFolder0," "C:\MachiavelliFolder1," and so on.
6.Optionally, it can log the folder creation results to a log file.
## How convert it as .exe format 
Convert the code into the .exe format using windows command prompt 
1. Write the code on the notepad and save it where you want (like i saved it on desktop)
2. Open cmd on windows
3. Use "cd" command to loacate directory of the file. (like i do cd Desktop to open up the directory to desktop where my file is located)
4. Now if you have installed g++/means c++ write the command g++ your-file.cpp -o your-file.exe and press enter button.
5. You can able to see that your file is now converted into the .exe format 
## Purpose:
