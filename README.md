# MCM-Memory-Consumption-Malware
This C++ program is a simple folder creation utility that continuously creates folders in a specified directory. It's a basic example to demonstrate folder creation using the Windows API.

## Description
This program uses the Windows API function CreateDirectory to create folders in the "C:\" directory with names like "MachiavelliFolder0", "MachiavelliFolder1", and so on. It continues creating folders until an error occurs.

## Usage
Compile the code using a C++ compiler.
Run the compiled executable.
Check the "C:\" directory to see the created folders.
Feel free to modify the basePath and folderName variables to customize the folder creation location and naming.
