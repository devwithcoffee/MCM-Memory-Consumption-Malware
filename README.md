# Modified - MCM 2.0 (Memory Consumption Malware)
## Description: 
This C++ program creates an indefinite number of folders in the C:\ drive on a Windows system. The program does the following:

1.Sets a base path to "C:."
2.Defines a folder name as "MachiavelliFolder."
3.Initiates a count variable to track the number of created folders.
4.Uses Windows API functions to hide the console window.
5.Enters an infinite loop that creates folders in the form of "C:\MachiavelliFolder0," "C:\MachiavelliFolder1," and so on.
6.Optionally, it can log the folder creation results to a log file.
## Purpose: 
This code serves as an example of using Windows API functions to hide the console window and perform repetitive tasks like creating folders.

Note: The code runs indefinitely, creating folders until manually terminated. Use it responsibly, and avoid running it without understanding its purpose.
